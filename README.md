# Deploy-an-Application-to-Amazon-ECS AWS-Project
Deploy an Application to Amazon ECS With EC2 | Docker | ECR | Fargate | Load balancer | AWS Project

I demonstrated how to deploy a web application to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) using various tools such as EC2, Docker, Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Application Load Balancer in AWS
I started by creating an EC2 instance and installed Docker on it using the Putty CLI. I went ahead and made a docker image using the CLI as well. I was able to push the container image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Moving forward I created an Cluster in Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), ECS Service and a Task definition that specifies how the container should be run. 
Lastly I created a load balancer that distributes traffic evenly across the instances in the ECS cluster and tested the project via the cluster to ensure it was working properly.
